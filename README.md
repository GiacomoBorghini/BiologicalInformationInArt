In this repository is reported the Matlab code used to obtain the results of the paper 
presented to NanoCom 2024 conference, titled "Detection of Biological Information in Art: An Information Theoretic Perspective to Measure Creativity". The paper refers to two methods: Informational Aesthetics and Wavelet domain Hidden Markov Trees (WHMT). Here are explained how to run the Matlab code which is provided as well in this repository. 


# Informational Aesthetics
## Global Aesthetics Measures
The main code to run to get the results is contained in **_Global_Aesthetics_general.m_** . This is main function and provides the graphics of the comparison, between AI and human paintings, of the M_H and M_K metrics. To run this code is necessary to have in the same folder the functions:
* **_resize_save.m_**
* **_M_H_K.m_**
* **_natsort.m_**
* **_natsortfiles.m_**

The last two has been taken from the File Exchange section of Matlab website (link: https://it.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/47434-natural-order-filename-sort)

## Compositional Aesthetics Measures


# Wavelet domain Hidden Markov Trees
